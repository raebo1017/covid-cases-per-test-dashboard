# COVID-19 Cases Per Test Dashboard

Cases per test is defined as number of cases / number of tests. It is also known as positivity rate. This project is a web application consisting of a [frontend](./covid-cases-per-test-dashboard-frontend) written with TypeScript and React and a [backend](./covid-cases-per-test-dashboard-api) data API written with Java and Spark Java web framework.

The app shows a choropleth map of US states colored base on their cases per test values. Clicking on a state shows a time series of the historical cases per test values for that state.

## Running the Dashboard
